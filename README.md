TEACH 03 : CSS PROPERTIES
Due Friday at 5:00 PM MST

Instructions
The Teach One Another activity this week will to explore the capabilities of CSS. You and your team are to try to make the most outlandish and dramatic changes to a simple HTML document using CSS alone.

There are two parts to this assignment. The first is to describe CSS effect that can be used for a web page; the second is to apply these changes to an actual style sheet.

Describe
In this discussion board, post findings about various CSS styles that may be applicable for a given web page. Each finding will have its own thread. The post should have the following parts:

Title: In a few words, describe the effect that the given CSS property will achieve.
Example: Put a small piece of CSS in the body of the post that creates the effect.
Explanation: Describe how it works, including any options or values.
Reference: Provide a link to w3schools or another site where someone can learn more.
This part of the assignment will constitute up to 50% of your grade. Each complete post will be worth 10%, so five posts will be needed.

Apply
The second part of the assignment is to apply what you have learned about CSS to a given example. In this case, there is a simple HTML document with four associated style sheets. Through some JavaScript code, the viewer of the page can switch between the style sheets with a click of the button.

Your assignment is to work with your group on making the visual presentation of the content of the page change as drastically as possible through the style sheets. This includes the coloring, fonts, as well as the layout of the page itself. Points will be awarded according to how dramatically the presentation of the page changes.

Start with week03.html. Since your entire group will edit the same document and submit it together, you will need to contact each of them and come up with a collaboration strategy. I suggest you create a post in this discussion board with proposals how this is to be done and with your group's final decision.

You can post your solution anywhere you want. You may wish to put it under your public_html directory on the Linux system. Regardless of your decision, make it clear to the instructor where the final page is located so it can be graded. In other words, put a link in the discussion board to the page.
